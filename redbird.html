<P><b>Cardinal or Redbird  Cardinalis cardinalis</b>
<br/>

<i>Habitat:</i>
</br>
    <p>The Cardinal is found throughout Bermuda but is quite uncommon. It is most likely to be seen in areas where there are plenty</p> <p>of trees such as parks and gardens. It may also be seen in mangrove swamps, woodland and agricultural land.</p>
	<p>Characteristics:</p>
	<p>The male Cardinal or Redbird is a very distinctive bird as it is almost all red and has a pronounced crest. It reaches about <p>9 inches (22 centimetres) in length. The front of the head, including the eye is jet-black. The female is a duller bird with <p>a reddish-brown body; there is some red on the crest, wings and tail. Another prominent feature common to both sexes is the <p>large, heavy, short beak which can be used to crush quite large seeds such as those of the Sunflower. Both sexes have <p>dull-purple legs. The breeding season is spring, when nests are built in trees. Two or three brown eggs covered in darker <p>speckles are laid. Redbirds have quite a varied diet of seeds, fruit and various insects. They will come to bird feeders stocked <p>with Sunflower Seeds. In winter, Redbirds are sometimes seen in small flocks of 20 birds or less.
	<p>Naturalised.</p></center>
