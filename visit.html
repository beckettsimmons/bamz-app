<p><b><br/><br/>Booking Our Bus
Bringing students to BAMZ could not be easier!
Teachers can book our free bus to collect students from your school and deliver them to our front entrance or to any one of our guided field trip destinations, including our boat. At the end of your activity, our bus driver, Mr. Richards will be happy to deliver you back again.
In order to avoid disaapointment, please plan ahead and book our bus at least several weeks in advance of your class trip.
Please email dlboyer@gov.bm or call 293-2727 ext. 2118 to book the bus and set up your class trip today.<br/><br/>
Booking Our Boat
Do you want to explore Bermuda's marine environment with your class for free? 
The BZS's boat, the Endurance, makes a great floating classroom and can take the students anywhere on our coral reef platform. Visit North Rock to snorkel over pristine reefs or stop in at one of the local bays to look for foraging seaturtles. We find that immersing students in our pristine marine environment energises and excites them about our island home.
To book today, email dlboyer@gov.bm or call 293-272, ext. 2118. Be sure to book at least several weeks in advance to avoid disappointment.

<h2><a href="#camp">Summer Day Camp Visits</a></h2>
<p><b>As BAMZ is particularly busy during the summer, we offer special programmes for visiting camp groups to alleviate overcrowding and inconveniences. These programmes run from 1st July–30th August. Please take advantage of these services. We look forward to your visits! (Group visits must be booked two weeks in advance through the Education Department, telephone 293-2727 ext. 2142.)<br/><br/>
Special rates apply to groups of 10 or more: $4 for children aged 5 to 12 inclusive; $8 for 13 years and older. Children under 5 years are admitted free.
<br/><br/>
Groups that have booked will be met on the front porch by a member of the Education Department and given further instructions.
<br/><br/>
If a group arrives late and the Aquarium facility is too full, the group may be asked to wait until space becomes available in the facility, or be asked to start their visit in the Zoo.
A Summer Day Camp Programme Admittance/Confirmation Form must be completed for all groups. This form should be handed to the Front Desk Receptionist upon arrival at BAMZ on day of visit.
<br/><br/>
The Discovery Room is closed to the public from 1st July-30th August, due to Bermuda Zoological Society Aqua Camps.
