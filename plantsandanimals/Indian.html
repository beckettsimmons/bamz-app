CommonName":"Indian Laurel","ScientificName":"Ficus retusa","ReflectImageSrc":"Indian Laurel 1_1.png","MainImageSrc":"Indian Laurel 1_1.jpg","MainImgHeight":"600","MainImgWidth":"450","DetailImageSrc":"Indian Laurel 2_1.jpg","DetailMediaType":"image","Credit":"Photographs by Anne Glasspool and text by Martin L. H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>Indian Laurel was originally introduced into Bermuda as an ornamental tree, and indeed it can make a very fine specimen tree. However, it has three unfortunate characteristics. First it can act as a 'strangler tree'. This means it can climb up the outside of other trees as slender trunks and eventually kill its support. The second problem is that it is spread very readily, as seeds, by birds and the third is that it can grow almost anywhere, on walls, roofs, posts and other structures where it can do great damage. Thus its habitat has expanded from gardens and parks to virtually any dry habitat.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>The Indian Laurel is one of the Fig or Ficus family. It can form a very large tree at least 60 feet or 20 metres high. The trunk is relatively smooth but tends to be very uneven with large ridges running up the trunk. Additionally, it can send roots down to the ground from the branches, which can thicken and form secondary trunks. Another growth form is as a series of narrow, vine-like trunks up the outside of the trunk of a living tree. The leaves of this tropical tree are quite small in size and bright green and shiny. The leaf texture is rather leathery and it has an elongated, slender tip. These characteristics and the fact that it will grow in dim light, makes small specimens popular in buildings such as banks.	</p><p>Introduced.	</p><p>	</p><p></p>
