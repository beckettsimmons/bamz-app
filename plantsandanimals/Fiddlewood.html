C"CommonName":"Fiddlewood","ScientificName":"Citharexylum spinosum","ReflectImageSrc":"Fiddlewood 1_1.png","MainImageSrc":"Fiddlewood 1_1.jpg","MainImgHeight":"600","MainImgWidth":"451","DetailImageSrc":"Fiddlewood 2_1.jpg","DetailMediaType":"image","Credit":"Photographs and text by Martin L. H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>Fiddlewood, an introduced tree, is now the most common tree species of woodland island-wide. It can be found in lowland, valley and upland areas.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>Fiddlewoods are large forest trees growing up to 50 feet (15 metres) in height, with a spread of at least 30 feet (19 metres) and with a heavy trunk that can reach 3 feet (1 metre) in diameter. The leaves are large, about 5 inches (13 centimetres) in length, quite narrow and pointed at the tip, the sides of each leaf are quite wavy. The tree forms a heavy canopy of leaves and in dense stands of Fiddlewoods very little sunlight reaches the ground. Fiddlewoods are rather unusual in that they shed their leaves in spring rather than autumn. Before the leaves are shed, they turn to a beautiful reddish to golden colour. After the old leaves fall in early summer, new growth appears quickly along with long sprays of small, white, 5-petalled flowers that are very fragrant and attractive to bees, making the Fiddlewood important as a source of honey. Round, red berries follow the flowers and are eaten by birds resulting in seed spread to new areas. The wood of the Fiddlewood is quite dense and hard and potentially useful for furniture. It is little used in Bermuda except as firewood. The name of the tree is a bit confusing since one would think that the wood might be used for fiddle making. This is not so, the name probably comes from the sound the wind makes on moving through the leaves.	</p><p>Naturalized.
