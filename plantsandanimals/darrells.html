<CommonName":"Darrells Fleabane","ScientificName":"Erigeron darrellianus","ReflectImageSrc":"Darrell's Fleabane 1_1.png","MainImageSrc":"Darrell's Fleabane 1_1.jpg","MainImgHeight":"449","MainImgWidth":"600","DetailImageSrc":"Darrell's Fleabane 2_1.jpg","DetailMediaType":"image","Credit":"Photographs and text by Martin L. H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>Darrells Fleabane is a quite rare plant found in coastal sandy soils, particularly along the south shore. Typically the location is partly shaded and surrounded by trees or shrubs. It is also present in sand dunes.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>This plant is a member of the daisy family. When in flower its most obvious characteristic is the large clumps of very small white daisies, with numerous white petals and a yellow center. The flowers are no more than 1/2 inch (1 1/2 centimetres) in diameter. The flowering season is the spring, mainly March and April. Once the flowers are gone the plant is quite difficult to identify. The large leaves form a rosette at the ground surface and from these rosettes stems rise vertically, with leaves at intervals, to carry the flowers and later the seeds. The seeds are small and have a clump of hairs attached which helps them to get dispersed by the wind. The whole plant may be at least 3 feet (1 metre) high but is often smaller. The leaves are quite spear-shaped, widest in the middle and with very coarsely-toothed edges. They are of a bright light-green colour with quite a shiny surface and have leaf stalks about half as long as the leaf blade. The leaves at the base are largest and may reach 6 inches (15 centimetres) in length.	</p><p>Endemic.
