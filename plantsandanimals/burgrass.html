CommonName":"Bur Grass","ScientificName":"Cenchrus tribuloides","ReflectImageSrc":"Bur Grass 1_1.png","MainImageSrc":"Bur Grass 1_1.jpg","MainImgHeight":"600","MainImgWidth":"398","DetailImageSrc":"Bur Grass 2_1.jpg","DetailMediaType":"image","Credit":"Photographs and text by Martin L. H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>Bur Grass is found on sand dunes behind the fore which are the largest dunes towards the sea. It is typically scattered among other low dune vegetation. The best area to observe this grass is in the South Shore Park.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>This native plant grows in the harsh, dry conditions of the sand dunes. It was probably abundant in the past when sand dunes covered huge areas in Bermuda. Now it faces a dwindling habitat and is not common even there. If you step on this grass in bare feet, you will regret it, but will experience its most distinctive feature; the flowers have quite-long, very sharp spines radiating from a round structure about 3/8 of an inch or 7 millimetres in diameter. The leaves arise from a long, ground-hugging, branching stem and are 2.5-5 inches or 6.5-13 centimetres in length, the leaves are usually flat but may curl in during hot-dry conditions. The leaves have a sheath at their bases which clasps the stem. This grass flowers from spring to autumn. Bur Grass also occurs in the SE USA, the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and south to Brazil.	</p><p>Native.
