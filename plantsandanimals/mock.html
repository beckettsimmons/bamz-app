<i>Habitat:</i>

{"ReflectImageSrc":"Mock Orange or Pittosporum 1_1.png","DetailImageSrc":"Mock Orange or Pittosporum 2_1.jpg","CommonName":"Mock Orange or Pittosporum","Description":"Habitat:\t\r\nMock Orange is an introduced tree for use in gardens and hedging. It can now be found almost everywhere, from just above the upper tidal limit to wasteland, open spaces and woodland.\t\r\n\t\r\nCharacteristics:\t\r\nMock Orange is a shrub or small tree growing up to 18 feet or 6.5 metres in height and at least 10 feet or 3 metres broad. The leaves are very densely crowded making the shrub a good barrier. The broad leaves which are up to 4 inches or 10 centimetres long are an elongated egg shape, with the broader part towards the end. The leaves are a shiny, dark-green on top and a dull, light-green underneath. A characteristic feature is that the leaves roll downward at the edges. The creamy-white flowers produced in spring, are very fragrant and produced in tight clusters. The flowers are followed by the green, capsule-like fruit which, when mature, split into 3 sections containing red, sticky seeds. Mock Orange was originally a garden and hedge plant but it was very well suited to the Bermuda climate and moved into the wild, becoming naturalized. It grows in all types of soil including peat, and has appeared in almost all land habitats. It is quite salt resistant and is not uncommon just above high tide mark. It provides good cover for birds. There is no doubt that in some places such as peat basins it out-competes native shrubs, however, on the whole it is not considered a serious pest species and has remained scattered in distribution.\t\r\nIntroduced.\t\r\n\t\r\n","MainImageSrc":"Mock Orange or Pittosporum 1_1.jpg","MainImgWidth":"473","AnimalID":"{5AB3099E-30D9-4B13-819C-357024F5D1B1}","MainImgHeight":"600","Credit":"Photographs and text by Martin L.
