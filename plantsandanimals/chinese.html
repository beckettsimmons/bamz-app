CommonName":"Chinese Fan Palm","ScientificName":"Livistonia chinensis","ReflectImageSrc":"Chinese Fan Palm 1_1.png","MainImageSrc":"Chinese Fan Palm 1_1.jpg","MainImgHeight":"455","MainImgWidth":"600","DetailImageSrc":"Chinese Fan Palm 2_1.jpg","DetailMediaType":"image","Credit":"Photographs and text by Martin L H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>The Chinese Fan Palm was introduced by man as an ornamental tree. In Bermuda it started in garden locations, but quickly spread into the wild and became naturalized. Unfortunately, it then became very invasive and invaded almost all land habitats in Bermuda with the exception of mangrove swamps, salt marshes, marine ponds and freshwater ponds, although it will grow right up to and overhang ponds of all types.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>The Chinese Fan Palm is remarkably similar to the Bermuda Palmetto. It is a small to medium-sized palm growing to about 25 feet or 8 metres. The trunk is quite varied in width but about a foot or 30 centimetres is average. It is quite rough and pale-brown. As with all palms the leaves are all in a rosette at the top of the trunk. The leaves almost form a ball at the top of the trunk, some dangling down. The leaves or fronds are quite long and the leaf stalk usually has a series of stout spines down each side. Where the leaf appears at the end of the leaf-stalk, the stalk ends abruptly. This is the most reliable distinguishing feature as the leaf stalk of the Bermuda Palmetto ends as a long taper going into the leaf itself. Flowers appear in very large sprays in spring and through the summer, then quite large, somewhat olive-like berries appear, finally blackening before they are shed.	</p><p>Introduced.
