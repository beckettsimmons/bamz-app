H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>Fennel is a culinary herb that was introduced by early settlers. It can now be found in gardens, roadsides, waste ground and parks.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>Fennel is a very aromatic plant that was first introduced for culinary purposes. This is quite a large herb reaching 2-4 feet or 75 to 120 centimetres in height. The stems are sturdy but not woody. The main distinctive feature of this plant is the leaves which are very finely dissected into almost hair-like lobes. The leaf-stalk is thick and quite long and at its base grows partly around the main stem. The flowers that appear at the ends of the stalks are in numerous, small clusters projected to form a virtually flat flower-head. The tiny individual flowers attract bees and are bright yellow. Each flower produces an aromatic, capsule shaped seeds about 1/4 of an inch or 5 millimetres long. The flowering season extends through summer into autumn. If the leaves are crushed in the hand, they give off a strong and very pleasant smell reminiscent of liquorice. This plant has become widely naturalized throughout Bermuda and is now considered as a weed. Fennel originated in Europe.	</p><p>Introduced.	</p><p>	</p><p></p>
