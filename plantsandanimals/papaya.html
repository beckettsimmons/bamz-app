<i>Habitat:</i>
</br>
CommonName":"Papaya or Paw-paw","Description":"Habitat:\t\r\nPapayas were introduced to Bermuda in the 1600s from Central America, and have since naturalized and spread into the wild. They are common in gardens and along sheltered roadsides.\t\r\n\t\r\nCharacteristics:\t\r\nPapayas are small to medium-sized trees with a maximum height of about 30 feet (10 metres), however, those growing to about 12 ft (4 metres) are more common. The trunk is quite smooth and rather fleshy; it is easily broken. There are regular rings around the trunk which are old leaf scars. The characteristic feature of the tree is that the leaves appear in a clump at the top of the trunk. Each leaf has a long stalk and the leaf and stalk together may reach 4 1\/2 feet (1.5 metres) in length. The leaf itself is up to 8 inches (21 centimetres) across and complex in shape. Each of the deep-green leaves usually has seven lobes, each with a white mid-rib. Each lobe is also lobed. An unusual feature is that trees are uni-sexual. Whether they are male or female the flowers are yellow and are found in clumps on short stalks among the leaf bases. The flowering season is from Spring to Autumn. The illustration above is a cluster of male flowers. Female trees bear fruit which are oval in shape and may reach 8 inches (21 centimetres) long. They are green when unripe and are used as a vegetable; when yellow and ripe they are a tasty fruit. Papaya trees yield a variety of useful medicinal extracts. Papain is the best known of these and is used as a meat tenderizer or to treat Portuguese Man-O-War stings. \t\r\nIntroduced.\t\r\n\t\r\n","MainImageSrc":"Papaya or Paw-paw
