CommonName":"Cape Weed","ScientificName":"Phyla nodiflora","ReflectImageSrc":"Cape Weed_1.png","MainImageSrc":"Cape Weed_1.jpg","MainImgHeight":"443","MainImgWidth":"600","DetailImageSrc":"Cape Weed 2_1.jpg","DetailMediaType":"image","Credit":"Photographs and text by Martin L. H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>Cape Weed is a very low-growing native herb that can be found in a wide variety of habitats from just above the sea shore to inland open places. It needs full sun and will not grow in dense woodland. It forms dense mats on the ground.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>Cape Weed generally grows in a dense mat about 4-8 inches (10-20 centimetres) high. It has wiry stems that hug the ground and send up numerous vertical shoots that bear the leaves and the flowers. These shoots are very close together. The leaves are small, about 1/2 inch (1 centimetre) long. They are light green and quite diamond shaped. The outer two faces of the diamond are coarsely toothed, and the inner two edges smooth. At the end of the shoots the flowers are produced over a long season and take the form of a button-like cluster of very tiny light purple flowers around the edge of the button. The centre of the button, containing unopened buds is a deep purple. Cape weed can grow on quite unstable slopes, and there provides a very good stabilizing layer, preventing erosion even in severe weather. This little plant is quite salt-tolerant and will grow quite close to the coast where other plants have difficulty becoming established.	</p><p>Native.
