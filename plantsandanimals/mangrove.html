H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>The Black Mangrove is one of a small group of trees called mangroves that can grow with their roots in salt water. Black Mangroves are found in two habitats in Bermuda, in coastal bays behind Red Mangroves. It extends to just above high tide level. In some marine ponds they cover the intertidal zone and extend a little above and below it. The forests of mangrove trees are termed mangrove swamps. The sediment where they live is generally fairly firm mud, but may grade into sandy mud or even sand. Black Mangroves usually produce very numerous, pencil-like, vertical roots, which trap mud brought in by the tide as well as that washed off the land.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>Black mangroves can form large trees but they are generally about 25 feet or 8 metres high. They have a stout, strong trunk with rough, almost black bark, a feature which gives this tree its name. The leaves are four inches or ten centimetres long with a blunt tip and tend to be a greyish-green in colour. In the sun, in dry weather, they sparkle with salt crystals secreted by special glands. The flowers are small and white and appear in spring. The seeds produced are quite large, thick discs and very buoyant, they can float for long distances on the sea and if they come to rest in a suitable location they grow quickly. The best distinguishing feature of the black mangrove is the host of pencil-like, air breathing roots which stick straight up from the sediment beneath the tree. In some locations these roots support a very dense growth of a dull greenish-red seaweed which makes them look like tiny Christmas trees. Black Mangroves shed leaves all the year round and these rot on the mud, or in the water, to produce detritus, a vital food for many coastal fishes and shrimps.	</p><p>Native.
