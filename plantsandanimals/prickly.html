,"ScientificName":"Toxicodendron radicans","DetailMediaType":"image"},{"ReflectImageSrc":"Prickly Pear 1_1.png","DetailImageSrc":"Prickly Pear 2_1.jpg","CommonName":"Prickly Pear","Description":"Habitat:\t\r\nThe Prickly Pear is a cactus typical of areas just inland of rocky and sandy shores. It thrives in poor, dry soil that has occasional salt spray.\t\r\n\t\r\nCharacteristics:\t\r\nPrickly Pears are typical of the group of cactus plants that have broad, flat pads. In the Prickly Pear, these reach 6 inches (15 centimetres) in length and about 4-4 1\/2 inches (10-12 centimetres) in width. The thickness is close to 1\/2 inch (1 centimetre). These pads are really sections of stem, the plant being almost leafless. Newly formed pads do have tiny leaves which show as small, green tabs by each group of spines. They quickly wither and die. As in most cacti, the Prickly Pear has very prominent groups of sharp spines, scattered like pincushions over the pad. In each pad, there are two sizes of spines, large, sharp, robust brown ones, and almost too small to see, a tuft of tiny, white spines among the large ones. Although the big spines appear to be the most fearsome, and indeed can give a nasty prick, it is the small ones that give most trouble if you touch them. These tiny, almost hair like spines are barbed. Once in your skin, they are painful and most difficult to remove. To handle the cactus pads one is wise to wear stout leather gloves.\t\r\n\t\r\nPrickly Pear plants often reach 3 feet (1 metre) in height. From spring to autumn, they bear showy, large, bright-yellow flowers. These flowers are remarkable in that the cluster of hair-like stamens inside react quickly to touch by curling inward. This is an adaptation to transfer more pollen to visiting insects. The flowers are followed by somewhat pear-shaped, green fruit up to 1 1\/2 inches (4 centimetres) long that ripen to a pinkish red. These fruit are highly edible and used on a wide scale, however, beware; they have tufts of the small, barbed spines! To harvest them you need to rub-off these spines with stout gloves. The flesh inside is sweet and red in colour.\t\r\nNative.\t\r\n\t\r\n","MainImageSrc":"Prickly Pear
