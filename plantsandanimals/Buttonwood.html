CommonName":"Buttonwood","ScientificName":"Conocarpus erectus","ReflectImageSrc":"Buttonwood 1_1.png","MainImageSrc":"Buttonwood 1_1.jpg","MainImgHeight":"458","MainImgWidth":"600","DetailImageSrc":"Buttonwood 2_1.jpg","DetailMediaType":"image","Credit":"Photographs and text by Martin L. H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>Buttonwood is considered to be a mangrove tree because it occurs at the landward fringe of mangrove swamps in salty soil. However, this tree also occupies the edges of inland reaches, channels and partly sheltered bays where it grows as a single line forming a fringe between land and sea. As a further index of its versatility the Buttonwood is also the characteristic plant of very exposed locations along the south shore where it appears at the cliff edge or partly up a rocky slope in a very stunted form that is highly wind-resistant.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>In sheltered locations, the Buttonwood grows as a small tree up to about 20 feet or 6 metres high. It has a thick trunk covered in rough bark that is usually far from straight and may be quite twisted. The branches grow thickly and the leaves are medium-sized and leathery in texture. The leaf colour is a dull grey-green. A very frequent feature of Buttonwood is that the leaf stalk has two small wings on the sides of the leaf-stalk between the leaf and the branch. The flowers which appear in spring are small spherical fuzz-balls; the fruit that follows is reddish in colour, hard and like a round cone. In the past these were used for buttons, hence the trees name. In very exposed locations, Buttonwood has virtually no trunk and grows as a tangle of wiry branches close to the rock surface. The whole plant may be no more than 6 inches or 15 centimetres high.	</p><p>Native.
