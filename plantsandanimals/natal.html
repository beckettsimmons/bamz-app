<i>Habitat:</i>
</br>
"CommonName":"Natal Plum","Description":"Habitat:\t\r\nThe Natal Plum shrub has been introduced to many gardens and has also gone wild (naturalized) in certain habitats, particularly in somewhat exposed, open places along the shorelines.\t\r\n\t\r\nCharacteristics:\t\r\nThis shrub grows to at least 10 feet (3 metres) high and to about the same width. It has firm, strong stems and branches forming a dense bush. At intervals along the branches, pairs of thorns about 1 inch (2 1\/2 centimetres) in length are produced on very short side branches. These thorns are greenish-brown with a red tip when young and a light brown when mature. They are very strong and quite sharp. The leaves, about 1 1\/2 inches (4 centimetres) long, are firm, leathery in texture and dark, shiny-green in colour. Their shape is a slightly elongated oval with a small sharp, downward-pointing tip at the end. Another distinctive feature of the shrub are the white or very pale mauve, six petalled flowers, about 1 1\/4 inches (3 centimetres) In diameter. The flowers are highly-fragrant and attract insects. The petals are well separated and tend to curl up at the edges giving a propeller-like appearance. The flowers are followed by the fruit which give this shrub its name. The plums 1 1\/2 inches (4 centimetres) long and about an inch (2 1\/2 centimetres) wide are very attractive. The colour is a bright red, streaked with white and darker-red. The fruit are very edible, but people are put off by the copious white latex that is produced if bitten in half. This latex is quite sticky and is used by the plants to heal wounds. For this reason, the fruit are best eaten whole and indeed they make a nice mouthful. Inside the fruit the pulp is whitish and contains numerous, black seeds. In some places, Ferry Point Park for example, Natal Plums produce dense, impenetrable thickets.\t\r\nIntroduced.\t\r\n\t\r\n","MainImageSrc":"Natal Plum
