H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>The Loquat is an introduced fruit tree. It is most commonly found in gardens but is also fairly common along roadsides.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics: 	</p><p>The Loquat is a small tree reaching about 25 feet or 7.5 metres in height. The leaves are very large, reaching 4-8 inches or 10-20 centimetres long. They have finely-toothed edges, are shiny and are wavy in texture due to a raised leaf surface between the lateral veins. The leaves are dark green and widest at about the middle. The undersides of the leaves are unusual in that they are woolly and brown. The tree bears numerous, small white flowers in the spring, in a crowded, woolly cluster at the twig ends and each flower has 5 petals. The flowers are followed by bright-yellow fruit which are highly edible. These fruit about 1 1/2 inches or 4 centimetres long, are oval or pear-shaped in structure and have many small seeds. Loquat trees are highly valued for their fruit, which make excellent jams and jellies. This useful fruit tree has been widely planted in tropical and sub-tropical countries and it usually grows luxuriantly.  The Loquat is Native to Japan.
