One of their characteristic features is a huge spread which can extend to twice the height. The very robust trunk and branches are quite smooth and an attractive light-grey in colour. The leaves which are shed in autumn are another very attractive feature of this tree. The leaves are large and feathery in appearance. The leaf mid-rib gives rise to numerous side branches on which the tiny, elongate leaflets are arranged in a row down each side. Leaf length may reach about 1 foot (30 centimetres) or more. The greatest attraction of this tree is the magnificent flowers which are  borne in large bunches in summer. Each flower may be 4 inches (10 centimetres) across and has 5 petals. Four of the petals, which are spoon-shaped, are brilliant-red with small patches of darker red. The fifth petal, found at the top of the flower, is pink in ground-colour with deep-pink streaks and edge. Additionally, where the bowl of the spoon narrows to the handle, there is a patch of yellow with red streaks. The handle is bright red. This tree is native to Africa, Madagascar and India.\t\r\nIntroduced\t\r\n\t\r\n","MainImageSrc":"Royal Poinciana
