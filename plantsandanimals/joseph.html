H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>Josephs Coat is common in open places, on roadsides, in forest clearings and in many parks and nature reserves.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics: 	</p><p>This is a medium-sized plant growing up to 2 feet or 65 centimetres tall. The stems are erect and firm. The leaves alternate on the stem and are very variable in size. They are quite narrow, strap-like in some plants, and up to 4 inches or 10 centimetres long. Some leaves may have scalloped or coarsely-toothed edges, but most are smooth-edged. The characteristic feature of this plant is the cluster of partly or fully bright-red leaf-like bracts, often with white patches, at the top of the stem. Most people think these are a flower. The real flowers are small, dull and greenish and appear as a cluster in the center of the coloured bracts. The flowering season encompasses the entire year. This attractive plant is native to Bermuda and is also widely distributed in tropical and sub-tropical North and South America.	</p><p>Native.	</p><p>	</p><p></p>
