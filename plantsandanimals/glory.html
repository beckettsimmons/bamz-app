H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>The Blue Dawn Flower is common in a wide variety of habitats including roadsides, the edges of woodland, inland open slopes, waste ground, marshes, the backs of mangroves and many parks.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>Blue Dawn Flowers, in common with all kinds of Morning Glory, are rampant vines that clamber over the ground or ascend into the branches of trees and shrubs. These vines can be many yards or metres long. The stems are very tough and have leaves at numerous intervals. The leaves, up to about 6 inches or 15 centimetres long, are usually three-lobed but just heart-shaped leaves are also common, they have a bluntly pointed tip. The mid-green leaves have prominent veins that are often coloured pink or red. The flower is very well known because of its great beauty. It is a beautiful sky-blue in colour accented by five rays of light pink or purple. There are five petals which are fused together to form a trumpet shape, the throat of which is pure white in the deepest part. The flowers, up to 10 centimetres or 4 inches across appear in the early morning and on hot days are gone by noon. In cool, damp weather they persist well into the afternoon. This is an introduced species native to tropical areas.	</p><p>Native.
