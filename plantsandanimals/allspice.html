A"CommonName":"Allspice","ScientificName":"Pimenta dioica","ReflectImageSrc":"Allspice 1_4.png","MainImageSrc":"Allspice 1_1.jpg","MainImgHeight":"448","MainImgWidth":"600","DetailImageSrc":"Allspice 2_1.jpg","DetailMediaType":"image","Credit":"Photographs and text by Martin L. H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>Allspice is a tree of upland and dry lowland forests. It is found virtually all over Bermuda in mixed stands with Fiddlewood and occasionally with Bermuda Palmettos and Bermuda Cedars. Where it has become well established it may make up at least half of the forest trees. It is now very common in Bermuda	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>The Allspice tend to be rather small trees usually up to about 25 feet or 7.5 metres high but in very favourable locations may reach 40 feet or 12 metres in height. It does not generally have a wide spread. The leaves are shiny and long, reaching 6 inches or 15 centimetres in length. The flowers which appear in sprays in spring are fragrant, small and white. The Allspice has two very distinctive features which make it stand out from other trees. Probably the most obvious of these is the interesting, light-coloured, smooth bark which peels in sheets. Less obvious but equally interesting is the smell of the fresh leaves. If a leaf is plucked from the tree and crushed in the hand it gives off the very characteristic and very pleasant Allspice smell.
