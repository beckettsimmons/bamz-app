"DetailImageSrc":"Pink Frangipani 2_1.jpg","CommonName":"Pink Frangipani","Description":"Habitat:\t\r\nPink Frangipani is an introduced, ornamental tree found in gardens, public gardens, hotel grounds and some parks.\t\r\n\t\r\nCharacteristics:\t\r\nThis is a small deciduous tree up to about 15 feet or 5 metres in height and with very thick twigs. Damaged trees exude copious quantities of white sap. The leaves, clustered at the ends of the twigs are very large, 3-8 inches or 7.5-23 centimetres long and oblong in shape; they are dropped in winter. The five-petalled flowers are large, about 1 1\/2 inches or 4 centimetres in diameter, very fragrant and shaped like a multi-bladed propeller. There is only a very tiny, tube shaped centre. The upper edge of each petal is thickened and turned up. The colour is a bright red-pink, getting redder towards the center of the flower. A variety of this species called var acutifolia, has creamy-yellow flowers. The flowers appear in the spring. This tree is the food source for the caterpillars of the Frangipani Hawk Moth. Pink Frangipani was introduced as an ornamental and fragrant tree. It is native to Central America.\t\r\nIntroduced.\t\r\n\t\r\n"
