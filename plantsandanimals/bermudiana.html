CommonName":"Bermudiana","ScientificName":"Sisyrinchium bermudiana","ReflectImageSrc":"Bermudiana 1_1.png","MainImageSrc":"Bermudiana 1_1.jpg","MainImgHeight":"453","MainImgWidth":"600","DetailImageSrc":"Bermudiana 2_1.jpg","DetailMediaType":"image","Credit":"Photographs and text by Martin L. H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>The Bermudiana has evolved in Bermuda to be a distinct species not found naturally anywhere else in the world. This makes it an endemic species even though specimens of this beautiful plant have been exported to many parts of the world to be cultivated in gardens. Bermudiana is one of the endemic plants that is very common here. It can be found in a wide variety of situations, examples being roadsides, waste ground, the landward part of sand dunes, soil pockets on exposed headlands etc. It is not, however, found in marshes and swamps where there is ever any standing water. At times in the past it was common enough to be regarded as a weed in farm fields.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>Bermudiana is not a grass but has very grass-like leaves. Close relatives in mainland North America are called Blue-eyed Grass. The leaves are a pleasant, delicate clump of bright green, but it is the flowers that endear this plant to Bermudians and visitors alike. The six-petalled flowers are a beautiful blue colour and each petal is tipped in a central pointed lobe with a blunt one on either side. The commonest shade of colour is a somewhat purplish-blue, but perfect sky blue flowers are frequent, as are those with a light-blue background veined with darker purple-blue. In all flowers the blue petals are set off by a vivid yellow centre, paling almost to white in the middle. In some locations exceedingly pale blue to virtually pure white examples are quite common. The Grass-like leaves grow up to at least 12 inches or 30 centimetres long and 1/2 inch or 1 centimetre wide. In spring, the flowers are borne on stiff stalks rising well above the leaves, so that in total the plant may reach 2 feet or 60 centimetres high. Individual flowers are 1/2-3/4 inches across (15-20 mm) and several may appear on each flower-stalk. In places where it is undisturbed, this plant may form large patches of hundreds of plants.	</p><p>Endemic.
