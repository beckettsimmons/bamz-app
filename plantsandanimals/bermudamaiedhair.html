H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>The Bermuda Maidenhair Fern is very widely distributed in Bermuda and can live on virtually any damp, shaded, rocky surface from cave mouths, to cuttings, to old walls, inland cliffs etc.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>The Bermuda Maidenhair Fern is a small, graceful, delicate fern. Several fronds up to 6 inches (15 centimetres) in length usually arise from a very short, central stem. Each frond is sub-divided into a series of side branches bearing many small fan-shaped leaflets. The stems are black and wiry and the leaves are a beautiful, soft green. Size and texture can vary greatly according to habitat and shading. Ferns reproduce by means of tiny spores and in the case of the Bermuda Maidenhair Fern, these are shed from black spots on the back-edge of the leaflets. This fern can be found anywhere in shade in the countryside of Bermuda.	</p><p>Endemic.	</p><p>	</p><p></p>"}
