<i>Habitat:</i>
CommonName":"Jumbie Bean, Acacia or Wild Mimosa","ScientificName":"Leucaena leucophala","ReflectImageSrc":"Jumbie Bean 1_1.png","MainImageSrc":"Jumbie Bean 1_1.jpg","MainImgHeight":"466","MainImgWidth":"600","DetailImageSrc":"Jumbie Bean 2_1.jpg","DetailMediaType":"image","Credit":"Photographs and text by Martin L. H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>The Jumbie Bean is found in a wide variety of habitats from open woods, woodland edges, open spaces and roadsides to parks.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>This is a small tree or shrub, usually the latter. This species can grow up to 30 feet or 9 metres in height, but most specimens are just a few feet or metres high. The plant spreads widely. The most characteristic feature is the leaves which are large being 4-12 inches or 10-40 centimetres in length. In structure they consist of 6-20 side shoots each with numerous small leaves arranged in pairs along both sides of the side shoots. These leaves called pinnae are elongated with a bluntly-pointed tip and 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch or 9-18 millimetres in length. The colour is an attractive blue-green. The flowers which can appear at any time of the year are in the form of fuzzy, globular balls about 7/8 of an inch or 22 millimetres in diameter. The flowers are followed by large seed pods 4-6 inches or 10-15 centimetres long which taper to a point at both ends (over). When mature, they contain beans which have been used as necklaces when strung onto a thread. This plant contains the toxic amino acid mimosine which can cause hair loss, goitre, infertility and weight loss in humans.	</p><p>Introduced.	</p><p>	</p><p></p></article>
