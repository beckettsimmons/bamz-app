CommonName":"Hibiscus","ScientificName":"Hibiscus rosa sinensis","ReflectImageSrc":"Hibiscus 1_1.png","MainImageSrc":"Hibiscus 1_1.jpg","MainImgHeight":"451","MainImgWidth":"600","DetailImageSrc":"Hibiscus 2_1.jpg","DetailMediaType":"image","Credit":"Photographs and text by Martin L. H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>Hibiscus shrubs can be found in a wide variety of habitats in Bermuda. They have been extensively planted in gardens and parks and are one of the main hedging shrubs used in Bermuda. Additionally, Hibiscus shrubs have become naturalized and are now found in any open location even quite close to the shore.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>The Hibiscus is a shrub and rather than having a single stem, several stems emerge from the ground to form the bush. Hibiscus shrubs can reach 9 feet (3 metres) but are usually somewhat smaller. The shrub is usually evenly shaped if standing alone. Hibiscus plants can also be planted quite close together to form a hedge. Planted in this way they form a nice thick hedge that can be clipped to shape. The leaves are mid-green and have a toothed edge. The most attractive feature of Hibiscus is that it produces large and very attractive flowers through most of the year although only sparingly in winter. Selective breeding has resulted in a wide range of flower colour. The flower has five large petals around a long cluster of yellow stamens. The pollen from these stamens is very difficult to remove from clothing. The flowers produce abundant nectar which attracts bees and a wealth of ants. These are often hidden until a flower is picked and then they pour out. Hibiscus flowers are often seen worn behind the ear in tropical countries.	</p><p>Introduced.
