Individual plants vary tremendously in size but even very small ones will flower. The leaves may be single or compound, each leaflet being about 2 1/2 inches or 6.5 centimetres long and 1 1/8 inches or 4 centimetres in width and quite thick and fleshy from top to bottom. Those leaves at the tip of a leaf-stalk are larger. The leaves are light-green with a reddish edge. The plant may flower profusely with numerous flowers which hang down. These flowers which are about 1 1/4 inches or 3 centimetres in length, are tubular and greenish-purple in colour at first but when they are fully mature, bright orange-red, pointed petals just project from the end. They flower from spring into early summer. The Flopper is an introduced plant which has become naturalized. It is Native to Asia. 	</p><p>Introduced.	</p><p>	</p><p></p></article>
