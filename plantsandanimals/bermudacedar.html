H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>The Bermuda Cedar was once found in almost all land and freshwater marsh areas in Bermuda. When the first settlers arrived it was the dominant tree almost everywhere from hill tops and sides, through upland and lowland valleys and marshes. Where it was abundant in freshwater wetlands it formed Bermuda Cedar swamps. This is an extraordinarily wide range of habitats for one species.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>Bermuda Cedar also has a wide range of growth patterns from tall stately trees at least 50 feet (15 metres) high in sheltered fertile locations to low, stunted, twisted specimens less than 3 feet (1 metre) tall along windswept coasts. The leaves are small and scale-like and the berries are a light greyish-blue. The wood is hard and very aromatic.	</p><p>Endemic.	</p><p>	</p><p></p>"},
