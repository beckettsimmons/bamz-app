CommonName":"English Plantain or Ribwort","ScientificName":"Plantago lanceolata","ReflectImageSrc":"English Plantain 1_1.png","MainImageSrc":"English Plantain 1_1.jpg","MainImgHeight":"469","MainImgWidth":"600","DetailImageSrc":"English Plantain 2_1.jpg","DetailMediaType":"image","Credit":"Photographs and text by Martin L. H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>English Plantain, an introduced plant, can be found almost anywhere including gardens, roadsides, field edges, inland grassy areas and cracks in walls.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>English Plantain forms a rosette of elongate leaves on the surface of the ground. There is virtually no stem. The leaves are very characteristic and have 3-5 ribs running along their length; hence the second common name. The leaves are long ranging from 2-12 inches or 5-30 centimetres in length; they increase gradually in width from the short leaf stalk to the center of the leaf, and then narrow again to the pointed tip. The leaves are a bright mid-green, somewhat shiny and sometimes are quite quilted-looking between the ribs. The flower heads are on stalks rising above the foliage and they are massed in a short oval spike and are small and inconspicuous except for the white anthers that stick out to the side. The seeds are round and black and are excellent food for small birds. Plantain leaves are edible and utilised by caterpillars and other insects as a food source. This plant was introduced from Europe and has become naturalized. It is now very widely distributed throughout the world in temperate and tropical regions. It flowers for most of the year.	</p><p>Introduced.
