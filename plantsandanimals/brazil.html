CommonName":"Brazil or Mexican Pepper","ScientificName":"Schinus terebinthifolius","ReflectImageSrc":"Brazil Pepper or Mexican 1_1.png","MainImageSrc":"Brazil Pepper or Mexican 1_1.jpg","MainImgHeight":"395","MainImgWidth":"600","DetailImageSrc":"Brazil Pepper or Mexican 2_1.jpg","DetailMediaType":"image","Credit":"Photographs and text by Martin L. H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Invaded Habitats:	</p><p>The Brazil or Mexican Pepper has invaded a wider variety of habitats than almost any other introduced species. It is now common along roadsides, in woodland, mangrove swamps and marshland as well as in exposed coastal areas. It will even grow in walls and on roofs. It is displacing many endemic and native plants and is very difficult to control.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>This tree tends to be quite small reaching about 15 feet (4.5 metres) high, but spreading almost as wide. The leaves are compound, commonly having 5-7 leaflets on the leaf stalk. If a leaf is picked and crushed in the hand, there is a pungent peppery smell; this characteristic gives the tree its name. The flowers are not showy but the berries borne in winter are numerous and an attractive bright red.	</p><p>Introduced.
