H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>Bermuda Olivewood trees were once widespread in the old forests of Bermuda but after the arrival of man they disappeared from all but a few localities, becoming rare. However, they have been widely planted in parks, nature reserves and gardens where they have been doing well. Olivewoods are small trees that live in association with native and endemic trees such as Bermuda Cedar and Bermuda Palmetto. They probably never occurred in pure stands of just Olivewood. Although Olivewoods like fairly sheltered locations such as valleys and sheltered hillsides best, they are occasionally found in windswept areas.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>Bermuda Olivewood is a beautiful small tree that has very dense foliage. They grow up to 25 to 40 feet (8-12 metres) high and in sheltered habitats have a very pleasing, regular shape, conical at the top and rounded at the bottom. In windy areas the tree growth is much less regular. The leaves are a beautiful mid-green in colour and with a firm texture and shiny surface. Each leaf, about 2 to 3 inches (5-7 centimetres) long, is an elongated oval in shape, bluntly-pointed at the tip and with small, widely spaced teeth along the sides. In spring the trees produce a profusion of small, creamy-white flowers in tight bunches. Yellow fruit, shaped rather like olives, ripen in the autumn. 	</p><p>Endemic.	</p><p>	</p><p></p>
