ScientificName":"Delonix regia","DetailMediaType":"image"},{"ReflectImageSrc":"Sea Ox-eye 1_1.png","DetailImageSrc":"Seas Ox-eye 2_1.jpg","CommonName":"Sea Oxeye","Description":"Habitat:\t\r\nThis attractive daisy-like plant is at home above the wave-washed zone along rocky shores. It will extend some distance back from the shore where the soil is poor and rocky.\t\r\n\t\r\nCharacteristics:\t\r\nThis beautiful member of the daisy family grows to 1-4 feet or 30-122 centimetres in height. The plants are generally scattered rather than clumped together. Both the leaves and stems are quite succulent and the leaves are quite thick and somewhat translucent. The slightly elongated oval leaves are widest about 2\/3 of the way to the tip and may be bright green or greyish-green in colour, but on a single plant, they are all the same shade. The leaves are 1-2 1\/2 inches or 2.5-6.5 centimetres in length and have no leaf stalk growing directly from the stem. The flowers are a magnificent bright yellow with numerous evenly spaced petals around the outer edge and numerous small florets in the center. These flowers are very attractive to bees. The flowering season includes spring and autumn. This common species is also found in Florida and the Caribbean Islands.\t\r\nNative.\t\r\n\t\r\n","MainImageSrc":"Sea Ox-eye
