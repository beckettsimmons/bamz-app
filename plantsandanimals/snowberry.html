H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>Bermuda Snowberry is one of the shrubs of the original Bermuda forest which was dominated by Bermuda Cedars and Bermuda Palmettos. That forest is now gone and with it most of the Bermuda Snowberries. Snowberries are now very rare inhabitants of the present forest under-storey. This means they grow in a layer below the tree canopy but above the ground layer. They do best in a moist sheltered environment but also occasionally occur in windswept locations in nature reserves. This species has been successfully re-established in the restored cedar/palmetto forest on Nonsuch Island.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>Bermuda Snowberry is a shrub about 5 feet or 1.5 metres high with branches that tend to bend down. The leaves are quite leathery, shiny and bright green with an elongated oval shape and smooth edges. The leaves have a sharp end that turns down. The leaf edges are often wavy. The rather tubular, small flowers are light-yellow in colour and appear in small sprays in early summer. The fruit, which gives the plant its name, are beautiful snow-white berries.</p><p>Native
