,{"CommonName":"Bermuda Palmetto","ScientificName":"Sabal bermudana","ReflectImageSrc":"Bermuda Palmetto 1_2.png","MainImageSrc":"Bermuda Palmetto 1_1.jpg","MainImgHeight":"419","MainImgWidth":"600","DetailImageSrc":"Bermuda Palmetto 2_1.jpg","DetailMediaType":"image","Credit":"Photographs and text by Martin L. H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>The Bermuda Palmetto is unique to Bermuda. Its ancestors from the mainland arrived thousands of years before man colonized the islands, probably coming as floating seeds or perhaps carried by birds. In Bermuda it evolved to a new species that was able to colonize an amazingly wide variety of habitats, from the tops of the highest hills to marshes and swamps in the valley bottoms. On higher ground it was probably scattered among Bermuda Cedars but in swamps, it formed almost pure stands of Bermuda Palmettos with just the occasional cedar. Such a Palmetto swamp can be seen in Paget Marsh. On hillsides too it sometimes formed almost pure Palmetto forest. A surviving example of this can be seen in Butterfield Park, Point Shares. It is very unusual for a tree to inhabit such a wide range of habitats.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>The Bermuda Palmetto is one of the 'fan palms', so called because the fronds or leaves are shaped like fans. The trunk is rough with many rings and shows the scars of previous leaves that have fallen. The green fronds arise from the very top of the trunk and form a very attractive plume. Close-up, the leaves are seen to consist of numerous ridges which have a very firm consistency. The leaf stalks are tough and have no spines on the sides. The leaf stalk has a long, tapering projection, clearly seen on the underside of the leaf, which distinguishes it from the introduced Chinese Fan Palm. Flowers are produced in a spray among the leaves and are followed by large clumps of olive-green to dark purple berries. The tree reaches at least 30 feet (10 metres) in height.
