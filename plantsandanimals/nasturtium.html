<i>Habitat:</i>
</br>
"CommonName":"Nasturtium","Description":"Habitat:\t\r\nNasturtiums are annual plants that can spring up almost everywhere except in very dense shade. They can be found on roadsides, in woodland edges, at the back of mangrove swamps and on rocky slopes.\t\r\n\t\r\nCharacteristics:\t\r\nNasturtiums are fleshy vines with stems at least 3 feet or 1 metre long. The leaves are almost round and up to at least 4 inches or 10 centimetres in diameter. The stalk is attached just below the centre. The flowers, up to 1 1\/2 in or 4 centimetres across, may be almost any shade of white, yellow, orange or red, they have five petals in two groups. The three lower petals are smaller than the two above. At the back of the flower is a long, hollow spur with nectar at the tip. The seeds are large and roughly oval and are sometimes pickled for use as a condiment. In places nasturtiums can produce ground-covering masses but seem to do this mostly where the ground has been disturbed.  They do not seem to establish themselves in areas of stable vegetation. The nasturtium was introduced for garden use and soon became naturalized in the wild. They flower throughout the year but more profusely in summer. This showy plant is a native of Peru. \t\r\nIntroduced.\t\r\n\t\r\n","MainImageSrc":"Nasturtium 1_1.jpg","MainImgWidth":"600","AnimalID":"{BC3E8980-012E-4826-BF8B-DD134966FF8F}","MainImgHeight":"469","Credit":"Photographs and text by Martin L.
