<i>Habitat:</i>
CommonName":"Casuarina, Whistling Pine or Whispering Pine","ScientificName":"Casuarina equisetifolia","ReflectImageSrc":"Casuarina 1_1.png","MainImageSrc":"Casuarina 1_1.jpg","MainImgHeight":"600","MainImgWidth":"450","DetailImageSrc":"Casuarina 2_1.jpg","DetailMediaType":"image","Credit":"Photographs and text by Martin L H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>Casuarinas can be found in virtually every habitat in Bermuda with the exception of the seashore. It is found on coastal cliffs, in sand dunes and all inland habitats except peat marsh habitats.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>Whistling Pine is a large tree growing 30-80 feet (10 to 25 metres) high under favourable conditions. The trunk which has reddish-grey, smooth but flaky bark, may grow to at least 18 inches (45 centimetres in diameter). The wood is hard and makes excellent firewood. One very distinctive feature of this tree is the shape and structure of the 'leaves'. These leaves are really small stems and are found in thick clumps at the branch and twig ends. Each leaf is like a thick hair about 1/32 of an inch (1 millimetre) in diameter and up to at least 12 inches (30 centimetres) long. Looked at closely the leaf is seen to be composed of numerous, jointed sections each about 1/4 inch (6 millimetres) long. The leaf can readily be pulled apart at these joints. There are separate male and female flowers, both on the same tree. The female flowers, when fertilized, produce a cone-like, hard structure with sharp points on the surface. These cones shed numerous winged seeds which are spread far and wide by the wind. This results in young trees springing up everywhere, on roofs, in walls and even in the crotches of other trees. Casuarinas grow both in groves and as single trees. In groves they form a thick overhead canopy and the ground gets covered in shed leaves. In such situations, very little grows under the trees. Casuarinas are shallow-rooted and quite vulnerable to being toppled in hurricanes, or the trunk may break off half way up.	</p><p>Introduced.	</p><p>	</p><p></p>.
