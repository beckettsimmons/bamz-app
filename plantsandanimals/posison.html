"ScientificName":"Plumeria rubra","DetailMediaType":"image"},{"ReflectImageSrc":"Poison Ivy_1.png","DetailImageSrc":"Poison Ivy 2_1.jpg","CommonName":"Poison Ivy","Description":"Habitat:\t\r\nPoison Ivy is a plant of woodlands, forest edges, waste ground and some parks and nature reserves.\t\r\n\t\r\nCharacteristics:\t\r\nThis unpleasant plant can grow either as a vine or as a shrub. The latter is much more common. The vine clings to tree bark by means of aerial rootlets. The shrub form is commonly 3-4 feet or 100-135 centimetres high and often grows in quite dense patches in woodland. A characteristic feature is that the leaf consists of three leaflets clustered at the end of quite a long leaf stalk, while the leaflets themselves have only short stalks. The leaflets range from 1-4 inches or 2.5-10 centimetres long, and the breadth is about  2\/3 of the length. They are bright to dull green and somewhat shiny. The leaf and leaflet stalks are a reddish colour, particularly in the case of fresh spring growth. The flowers arising in the axils of the upper leaves are a very dull, greenish-brown and in a short spray about 1 inch or 2.5 centimetres long. Contact with this plant can cause a very painful rash in sensitive people; it should never be burnt as the smoke produced can harm the lungs. It is the most poisonous wild plant in Bermuda. Poison Ivy is probably native to Bermuda although there is some suspicion that it was introduced. It is common in eastern North America from Canada south.\t\r\nNative.\t\r\n\t\r\n","MainImageSrc":"Poison Ivy_1.jpg","MainImgWidth":"399","AnimalID":"{8BB8C1A5-8196-4F9F-8924-5C8C7BFE2EE1}","MainImgHeight":"600","Credit":"Photographs and text by Martin L.
