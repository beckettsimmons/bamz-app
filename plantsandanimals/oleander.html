<i>Habitat:</i>
</br>
"CommonName":"Oleander","Description":"Habitat:\t\r\nOleander shrubs were introduced to Bermuda mainly as a hedging plant. Oleanders are also often planted alone in gardens and parks as specimen bushes. They are abundant in hedges island-wide but have also naturalized and spread to open areas.\t\r\n\t\r\nCharacteristics:\t\r\nOleanders have been developed to give a wide variety of flower colours including white, red and all shades in between. The flowers which are about 1 inch (2 1\/2 centimetres) in diameter, have five petals which overlap slightly. The flowering season includes most of the year although blossoms are sparse in mid-winter. The leaves, about 6 inches (15 centimetres) long, are narrow and pointed at the tip. They are robust and leathery to the touch and very poisonous if eaten by animals. The bush or shrub is usually taller than it is wide, and has many stems entering the ground. Oleander shrubs reach at least 10 feet (3 metres) in height.\t\r\nIntroduced.\t\r\n\t\r\n","MainImageSrc":"Oleander 1_1.jpg","MainImgWidth":"600","AnimalID":"{2AA403E9-C0BC-46D0-913D-ADD5A676F5BF}","MainImgHeight":"453","Credit":"Photographs and text by Martin L.
