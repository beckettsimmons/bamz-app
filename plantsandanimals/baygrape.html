CommonName":"Bay Grape","ScientificName":"Coccoloba uvifera","ReflectImageSrc":"Bay Grape 1_2.png","MainImageSrc":"Bay Grape 1_1.jpg","MainImgHeight":"485","MainImgWidth":"600","DetailImageSrc":"Bay Grape 2_1.jpg","DetailMediaType":"image","Credit":"Photographs and text by Martin L. H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>The Bay Grape is a coastal tree, particularly common along the south shore of Bermuda. It occurs in a variety of habitats from fairly exposed coastlines where it is rather stunted in growth, to more sheltered locations further away from the coast where it can grow quite large. It also occurs in the sand dunes behind the most seaward dune ridge.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>At its best, the Bay Grape may reach 25 feet or 7.5 metres tall and its spread may be almost as large. However, it is more commonly half this height and in exposed locations may be only 6 feet or 2 metres in height, or even less. The trunk is almost never straight and branches freely near the ground. The most characteristic feature of this tree is the leaves. These are very large and round reaching at least 6 in or 15 centimetres across. Young leaves may be a lovely orange colour with red veins; as they age the leaves turn to a mid-green with yellow veins and are shiny. The flowers which appear in summer are numerous and small. They grow on a long spike which tends to dangle down. The fruit which follow the flowers are at first green balls which closely resemble grapes. This characteristic gives the tree its name. When the fruit mature in winter they are a dark purple. Bay Grape fruit can be used to make jam or jelly. In more exposed areas, Bay Grape may form very numerous small trees with much smaller leaves. These stunted trees do not produce fruit as freely as those in more sheltered locations. The tree can grow in very dry areas, such as sand dunes and is tolerant of poor, salty soil.	</p><p>Native.	</p><p>	</p><p></p>"}
