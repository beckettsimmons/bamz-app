CommonName":"Coast Sophora","ScientificName":"Sophora tomentosa","ReflectImageSrc":"Coast Sophora 1_1.png","MainImageSrc":"Coast Sophora 1_1.jpg","MainImgHeight":"468","MainImgWidth":"600","DetailImageSrc":"Coast Sophora 2_1.jpg","DetailMediaType":"image","Credit":"Photographs and text by Martin L H. Thomas","Description":"<p>Habitat:	</p><p>Coast Sophora is an uncommon plant found in windswept locations above the south shore.	</p><p>	</p><p>Characteristics:	</p><p>This plant is in the pea family and grows as a shrub 3-9 feet or 1-3 metres tall, however, the stems are often bent down reducing the height. The young leaves are covered in very fine hairs, an adaptation to slow water loss in a dry windy place. However, the leaves become smooth and shiny with time. The leaves are compound with 5-8 leaflets on each side and one at the tip. Each leaflet is oval with a very bluntly-pointed tip and a very short, pinkish-coloured leaf-stalk. The leaves are a mid-green colour with an obvious center vein. The flowers are yellow and pea-like with the upper petals standing almost straight up. The flowers are followed by long pods, with long stalks, which are characteristically constricted between the large, round seeds. This plant is native Bermuda and very likely arrived by means of the seeds floating on the ocean.	</p><p>Native.	</p><p>	</p><p></p>
